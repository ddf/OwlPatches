Send a trigger to Gate input 1 or a gate to Gate input 2 to excite a frequency band in the sound spectrum based on the signal at L In and the Fundamental, Octaves, Density, and Tuning settings. Fundamental and Octaves are used to determine the portion of the spectrum that L In strums (shown at the top of the screen in Hz). Density determines how many "strings" are available in that range, acting like a kind of quantizer on the input. Tuning determines how strings are spaced within the frequency range from logarithmic to linear. Decay controls how quickly strings decay to silence after being plucked, Spread will excite nearby strings with each pluck, Brightness fades in overtones of plucked strings, and Crush reduces the sample rate of the harp output. Width stereoizes the harp output with a diffuser, which is followed by reverb with controls for blend, time, and tone.

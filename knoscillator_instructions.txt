Tune the oscillator with param A and use the left audio input for v/oct CV control. Pitch can be set with MIDI Note On messages. The right audio input controls the level of frequency-sync'd FM. Param B morphs between the three Knot equations. Params C and D set the P and Q coefficients. Buttons A and B will mute the overtones introduced by P and Q. An additional tone can be added by increasing S Volume with param E. Param H controls FM Ratio. Params AA (CC75), AB (CC76) and AC (CC77) "detune" P, Q, and S. Rotation speed around the X, Y, and Z axes is proportional to P, Q, and S. Output param F is the sine of the X rotation and output param G is the cosine of the Y rotation. Gate Out goes high for 10ms every time the Knot completes a rotation around any axis. Set rotation with params AE (CC79), AF (CC80), and AG (CC81). Return a param to zero to resume automatic rotation. Perlin noise can be added to the 3D points with param AD (CC78) for a distortion-like effect. Param AH (CC82) zooms the camera in and out.

Params A, B, and C set the P, Q, and S coefficients. Buttons/Gates 1 and 2 will mute the overtones introduced by P and Q. Param D morphs between the three Knot equations. Tune the oscillator with param H and use the left audio input for v/oct CV control. Pitch can also be set with MIDI Note On messages. The right audio input controls the level of frequency-sync'd FM with param AH controling FM ratio. Params E, F and G detune P, Q, and S. Rotation speeds around the X, Y, and Z axes are set with params AA, AB, and AC. Set rotation directly with params AE, AF, and AG (return a param to zero to resume automatic rotation). Perlin noise can be added to the 3D points with param AD for a distortion-like effect. Param BA zooms the camera in and out. Output param BB is the sine of the X rotation, BC is the cosine of the Y rotation, and BD is the sine of the Z rotation. Gate 1 is high when X rotation is between 0 and PI/2, Gate 2 for Y rotation.
